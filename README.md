### Hi ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dominik. I have a BSc Computer Science graduate from the University of Hull in England, and a Postgraduate Diploma in Advanced Software Technology from Swansea University in Wales. I am a Software Development Engineer at J.D. Power, and this repo contains all of my mobile app development projects that I did for fun while at university. They are not directly related to the professional work I am doing now.
